# Home-is-where-the-heart-is
Created for Global Game Jam 2019

This is the build repository for my project Home is where the heart is, created under Dust Storm Entertainment for Global Game Jam 2020.

Launch the game by running the executable HomeIsWhereTheHeartIs.exe

Controls:

Move the character with the mouse pointer

Click to shoot the closest enemy

Enter the heart to heal (you cannot not shoot while in the heart)

The small purple dots are health packs

The small white dots are upgrades for shooting speed and bullet damage

Any upgrade that touches the base will heal it

If the player is hit my any enemy all shooting upgrades will be lost
